Version 1.3.0
- Changed the Attribute Service to issue attributes with configurable names (as opposed to the same fixed attribute name).
- Changed the Attribute Service API to support both string-based simple attributes, and (group,role) complex attributes
- Removed all code related to parse attribute strings into (group,role) pairs
- Inserted example code to query Authorization Services deployed at ESG-JPL and ESG-PCMDI Gateways
- Merged with contributions from BADC
- Repackaged from "esg.saml" to "esg.security"
- Repackaged "esg.security.auth" to "esg.security.authn"

Note that the above changes alter the API of the SAMLAttributes interface, and consequently of the SAMLAttributesFactory interface:
any implementation of the factory interface must now generate attributes that have both a name and a value, either as simple strings
or as (group,role) pairs.
