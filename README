>>> DESCRIPTION

This project contains a web application that can be used to deploy an ESG Attribute Service and/or an ESG Authorization service.
Additionally, the packaged jar contains ESG utilities for parsing and producing SAML statements that can be used in other ESG SAML aware projects.

>>> PREREQUISITES

o Fairly recent distribution of Ant

o Ivy installed as Ant extension. When running from the command line, this means installing the Ivy jar into the ant lib/ directory.
To run the Ant tasks within an Eclipse environment (because Eclipse comes packaged with its own version of Ant), 
the Ivy jar must be copied into the Eclipse-specific Ant lib directory, or into the user's ~/.ant/lib directory.


>>> INSTALLING AND BUILDING FROM THE COMMAND LINE

After downloading the module from the ESGF GIT repository, cd to the top-level module directory and run ant:

cd esg-saml

ant make_dist
will create the jar and war files in the dist/ subdirectory.

ant test 
will run the tests.

>>> INSTALLING WITHIN ECLIPSE

This module is configured to be interpreted as both a Java and Dynamic Web Project by Eclipse
(after it has been compiled from the command line, so that all the jar dependencies are downloaded by Ivy).
Note that in order to run the web application from within the Eclipse (i.e. without deploying the war file
to a separate servlet container), you must first run the "make_web_dir" ant task, which will assemble
the Eclipse WebContent/WEB-INF directory from source files, configuration files and libraries found in the
module distribution.


>>> CONFIGURING AND RUNNING THE WEB APPLICATION

Deployment of the web application is controlled by the file esg/saml/config/application-context-specific.xml (in the src folder): 
comment out whichever service stack is not going to be deployed.

Assuming that the servlet container is started on localhost on port 8080, and that the application is deployed at the "esg-saml" context, 
the services are available as follows:

1) ESG Attribute service

URL endpoint: http://localhost:8080/esg-saml/saml/soap/secure/attributeService.htm

Run the client esg.saml.attr.main.SAMLAttributeServiceSOAPClient to execute a test query.

Note that by default, the ESG Attribute Service uses the class SAMLAttributeFactoryTrivialImpl which is a trivial implementation of SAMLAttributeFactory
that returns valid attributes only for a user identifier equal to "Test Openid". To use the service in conjunction with a specific
user attribute repository, create your own implementation of SAMLAttributeFactory and deploy it in the Spring context
as a bean named "samlAttributeFactory" (replacing SAMLAttributeFactoryTrivialImpl in application-context-specific.xml).

2) ESG Authorization Service

URL endpoint: http://localhost:8080/esg-saml/saml/soap/secure/authorizationService.htm

Run the client esg.saml.authz.main.SAMLAuthorizationServiceSOAPClient to execute a test query.

Note that the SAML Authorization Service uses the class SAMLAuthorizationFactoryTrivialImpl which is a trivial implementation of SAMLAuthorizationFactory
that returns valid authorizations only for the test user identifier "Test Openid" (for all resources and actions). 
To use the service in conjunction with a specific authorization repository, create your own implementation of SAMLAuthorizationFactory 
and deploy it in the Spring context as a bean named "samlAuthorizationFactory" (replacing SAMLAuthorizationFactoryTrivialImpl in application-context-specific.xml).

>>> TECHNICAL NOTES

o To allow flexibility in deployment (specifically, the capability of replacing the attribute and authorization factory implementations),
the Spring beans for each service are auto-wired by name, but not auto-deployed in the Spring context. 
Currently the URL end-points for the Spring controllers are set as fixed request mappings in the Java classes and cannot be changed.

o This project requires Java 1.6 because of faulty XML libraries in Java 1.5 and below. 
Alternatively, the correct XML libraries can be placed in the endorsed directory of a Java 1.5 distribution.
